# BackEnd-e-coleta
This project was made with the intention of knowing and learning new technologies, this is my first project built using Node.JS, all the contents of this project and the respective libraries were provided or indicated in a training offered by RocketSeat at NLW (Next Level Week).

the following technologies were used. _Node.Js_ as the main library, _Express_ as server, _knex_ to connect with the database(in this project _sqlite_ was used), _multer_ for file management on the request, _Celebrate_ to manage the inputs validation and _Typescript_ as a language for greater scalability and greater readability of the generated code.

to execute the project it is necessary run the `npm run knex:migrate`, `npm run knex:seed` and `npm run dev`.
